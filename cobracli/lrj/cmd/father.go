and usage of using your command. For example:

Cobra is a CLI library for Go that empowers applications.
This application is a tool to generate the needed files
to quickly create a Cobra application.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	fatherCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&fa, "fa", "defaultValue", "A help for fa")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	fatherCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
